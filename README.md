**File Corrupter** - **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This project allows you to select multiple files and corrupt them to make them unusable.

This is handy if you want to delete a file but make sure no-one can access it afterwards. Since deleted files can be brought back by multiple means, this tool corrupts files, so that even if someone recovers your files, they will not be able to read/open them. **Not even you! **
**Use at your own risk.**

This project is a fork of "rem2/file-corrupter" written in c# and allows for a pdf to be corrupted and rendered unusable.
